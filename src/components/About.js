          I am a frontend developer with experience developing websites and web applications.
          I have an Associate of Applied Science degree in computer programming with 3+ years of overall coding experience but no prior experience working for a company.<br />
          <br />
          My goals as a developer are aiming to solve real-world problems while striving to make people's lives better and easier through software, and I openly want to work with organizations that align with this philosophy.
          My current and future work will prioritize best practices and code readability, and I continuously seek out new challenges and things to learn.
