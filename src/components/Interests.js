          My recent and current work has been on the frontend, however, my long-term goal is to work on the full stack.
          I put a high importance on being well-rounded and the aspect of a jack-of-all-trades developer is very desirable to me.<br />
          <br />
          When I am not coding, I enjoy reading about and researching different technologies like machine learning, AI, and the blockchain.
          On the personal side, I like to get outdoors as much as possible and spend time with family and friends.
